# Automation-Bash

### About This Repository
  - This repository contains a collection of automation projects built using Bash scripting, specifically created for system administration tasks.
    
  -  Each script aims to tackle practical challenges, optimize workflows, and solve real-world problems encountered by system administrators.

  - These projects were inspired by my training for the RHCSA and CompTIA Linux + Certifications, reflecting both foundational and advanced automation concepts.
